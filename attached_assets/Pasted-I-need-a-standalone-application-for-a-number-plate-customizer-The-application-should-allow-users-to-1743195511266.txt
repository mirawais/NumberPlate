I need a standalone application for a number plate customizer. The application should allow users to customize their license plates with a live preview updating in real time as they make selections. The customization options should include:

Registration Number: Users will enter their vehicle registration number.

Plate Selection: Users can choose between "Front Only," "Rear Only," or "Both Plates" using radio buttons.

Badge Selection: Users can select a badge from the options we add in the admin panel.

Badge Background Color: Users can choose a background color for the badge. The colors will be dynamically added from the admin side using hex codes instead of color names.

Text Style: Users can select a text style, with specific styles managed from the admin panel.

Border Color: Users can pick a border color for the plate, dynamically managed from the admin panel.

Plate Surround: Users can choose a surround design from the options added in the admin.

Plate Type: Users can select the type of plate, such as a "Show Plate" or an "Electric Car Plate."

All these options should be dynamically managed from the admin side so that we can add, remove, or modify selections as needed.

Checkout & Payment Integration:
The app should allow users to complete their purchase through a checkout system.

PayPal will be integrated as the primary payment method for order processing.

The system should calculate the final price based on the selected options.

Once the payment is successful, the order should be processed, and the user should receive a confirmation.

Admin Panel Order Response Tab:
Additionally, I need an extra tab in the admin panel that shows order responses when a user completes an order. This response tab should display order details in a column-wise format, including:

Order ID

Payment Status

Quantity

All custom field selections (Registration Number, Plate Type, Badges, Colors, etc.)

The goal is to make the number plate customization process fully dynamic, user-friendly, and efficient, ensuring a smooth ordering experience with a live preview feature and a seamless PayPal payment system."
